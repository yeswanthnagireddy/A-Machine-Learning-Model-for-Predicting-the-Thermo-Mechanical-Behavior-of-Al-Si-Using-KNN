# A Machine Learning Model for Predicting the Thermo-Mechanical Behavior of Aluminum-Silicon (Al-Si) Using K-Nearest Neighbors

##  Abstract
Aluminum–Silicon (Al–Si) alloys occupy a central role in modern engineering systems, particularly in automotive and aerospace assemblies, due to their high strength-to-weight ratio and efficient heat transfer capabilities. However, characterizing the thermo-mechanical response of Al-Si under varying temperature and strain conditions via conventional experimentation or atomistic simulations is resource-intensive.

This project presents a **Machine Learning-based surrogate modelling approach** to predict key material characteristics—**Stress**, **Young’s Modulus**, and **Thermal Conductivity**—across a broad operating domain. A **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** regression model was developed and trained on an MD-guided synthetic dataset, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and offering a rapid alternative to traditional characterization methods.

##  Objectives
1.  **Data Generation:** Construct a comprehensive dataset representing Al-Si behavior across a temperature range of **200 K – 1000 K** and strain up to **0.15**.
2.  **Model Development:** Implement a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** regressor (`k=25`) optimized with **StandardScaler** preprocessing.
3.  **Prediction:** Simultaneously predict three distinct material properties based on thermal and mechanical inputs.
4.  **Validation:** Achieve a high coefficient of determination ($R^2 > 0.95$) to validate the model as a reliable design tool.

##  Methodology

### 1. Dataset Generation (MD-Guided)
To overcome the computational cost of running thousands of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, a synthetic dataset of **6,000 points** was generated using physically consistent behavioral models of Al-Si.
* **Inputs:** Temperature ($T$), Engineering Strain ($\varepsilon$).
* **Outputs:**
    * *Stress ($\sigma$):* Modeled using temperature-dependent elastic modulus.
    * *Young's Modulus ($E$):*Modeled to degrade non-linearly with increasing temperature.
    * *Thermal Conductivity ($\kappa$):* Modeled to decrease with temperature due to phonon scattering.
* **Noise Injection:** A controlled noise factor (4%) was introduced to mimic the stochastic thermal fluctuations inherent in real atomistic simulations.

### 2. Machine Learning Pipeline
* **Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor.
* **Hyperparameters:** `n_neighbors = 25`, `weights = 'uniform'`, `metric = 'minkowski'`.
* **Preprocessing:** Features were scaled using `StandardScaler` (zero mean, unit variance) to ensure temperature magnitude did not bias the distance metric.
* **Validation Strategy:** 70% Training / 30% Testing split.

## 📊 Model Performance

The KNN model demonstrated exceptional capability in mapping the non-linear thermo-mechanical landscape of the alloy.

| Target Property | Test $R^2$ Score | Error Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stress (GPa)** | **~0.96** | Low RMSE, robust against noise |
| **Young's Modulus (GPa)** | **~0.96** | Accurately captures thermal softening |
| **Thermal Conductivity** | **~0.96** | Correctly models inverse thermal trend |

### Visualization of Results
* **Actual vs. Predicted plots** show a tight alignment along the diagonal, confirming minimal prediction bias.
* **Property vs. Strain curves** (at 300K, 600K, 900K) illustrate smooth, physically realistic trends even when trained on noisy data.
